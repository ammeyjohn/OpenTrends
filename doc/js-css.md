**animate.css** is a bunch of cool, fun, and cross-browser animations for you to use in your projects. Great for emphasis, home pages, sliders, and general just-add-water-awesomeness.

**Reveal** CSS animation as you scroll down a page. By default, you can use it to trigger animate.css animations. But you can easily change the settings to your favorite animation library.

Advantages:

- Smaller than other JavaScript parallax plugins, like Scrollorama (they do fantastic things, but can be too heavy for simple needs)
- Super simple to install, and works with animate.css, so if you already use it, that will be very fast to setup
- Fast execution and lightweight code: the browser will like it ;-)
- You can change the settings
