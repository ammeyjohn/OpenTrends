**MediaElement.js** is a set of custom Flash and Silverlight plugins that mimic the HTML5 MediaElement API for browsers that don't support HTML5 or don't support the media codecs you're using.

Usually adding audio to a text story is an uncomfortable choice. Either the user reads or listens but never both. Until now.

SoundCite is a simple-to-use tool that helps content creators add audio to their stories. The audio is not isolated in a player positioned off to the side, interrupting the text or housed in a garish player that distracts content consumers from reading.

SoundCite's audio is just a link that plays right under the relevant text.

SoundCite audio adds emotion or context to the text. It never asks users to look away from what their reading. And, most importantly, it requires no technical skills to use.
