* [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) (**MIT**) - AngularJS lets you write client-side web applications as if you had a smarter browser.

It automatically synchronizes data from your UI (view) with your JavaScript objects (model) through 2-way data binding. To help you structure your application better and make it easy to test, AngularJS teaches the browser how to do dependency injection and inversion of control. Oh yeah and it also helps with server-side communication, taming async callbacks with promises and deferreds; and makes client-side navigation and deeplinking with hashbang urls or HTML5 pushState a piece of cake. The best of all: it makes development fun!
